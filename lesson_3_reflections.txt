When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

When I want to release my work to others. This will enable others to view the 
content and modify it on their local machines. Remote repositories are 
convenient for maintaining open-source projects.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Automatic updates from remote might introduce bugs or compilation errors when we are working on a new feature on our local repositories. It might also create merge conflicts, so it is better to pull changes manually.
