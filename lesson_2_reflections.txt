What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The files in the directory are marked as "untracked". The .git folder is created.
Initializing a repository is required to create a HEAD pointer and to enable us to track the history of files.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Working directory contains local changes. Repository contains latest committed version of the files and the history of changes of the files. Staging area helps us organize our commits better.
